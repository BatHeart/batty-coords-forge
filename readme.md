# Batty's Coordinates Mod

A Forge-compatible Minecraft client mod

## See your Location at a glance

* The X, Y and Z coordinates that locate the player's position in the world are normally displayed on the F3 Debug screen.

* This mod displays them discreetly in the top left-hand corner of the main game screen, so you don't have to leave F3 open to see them.

* It also indicates the direction that you are facing, in compass-direction terms.
